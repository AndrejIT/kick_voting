kick_voting
===========

Mod for Minetest game. Allow players to vote to make life of selected griefers and especially agressive players harder.

"Voting table" block can be placed and configured with specified player name.
Players can vote to punish or to forgive. Punishment becomes active when outwoted by 6.
Right now, punishment is that griefer is sent to "jail" coordinates 0,-2,0.
Votes are assigned "by IP".

To wote, players need to pay gold ingot. That requirement is 
to make it harder for griefers to use this mod against normal players.
